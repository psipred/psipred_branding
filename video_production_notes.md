# Video tutorial guide

1. Use OBS-studio, it's pretty easy
2. In settings. In Output->Recording. Quality is "High Quality, medium File size". Format is ".mkv". Encoder "Hardware (NVENC, H.264)" and audio encoder as AAC. Audio should be sample rate of 48Khz. Video base and outputs resolutions 1920x1080
3. When setting a scene and audio capture ensure only one audio capture device is enabled (you may have to mute mic/aux). 
4. When recording a take ensure you start with a pause of 5 seconds before first speak. This captures a sample of the audio floor which can be used for denoising.
5. At the end of each take pause for 5 of so seconds to give some footage of the desktop/final shot that can help in making cuts/edits
6. Each tutorial should be stand alone and should not assume someone has watched another tutorial. Though you can refer people to other tutorials so you don't have to repeat yourself. 
7. Walk through the input page and show how to submit a job, explain each extra option if there are any
8. If the job has a long runtime (over 1 min) then do two takes/captures, one for submission and one for describing the results
9. On the results page walk through each area of the results. If there is a table describe what each column means and if there is a link follow the link and show the user what is at the end of the link and explain why. Also provide some interpretation, what does the result the use see mean in context. If there are any gotchas in interpreting the results mention those. After that explain the downloads panel and each of the links. Download all the files. Then using a text editor open each file in turn and explain what is in there, making reference to the results page

## Productions Thoughts

I generally adlib the content and don't use a script. I would say it takes 2 - 20 takes to get a bit down. Sometimes you flub it immediately, sometimes you're 5 minutes in and you get tongue tied all of a sudden. Somedtimes you do a great take and 20 minutes later you realise you totally forgot to mention something. It's amazingly annoying

For the mic, if you're facing the mic then having something soft or curtain-y behind you is great if possible. A pop screen for a mic is great to avoid sibilants and plossives coming throught too much, though having the mic at right angles to you and talking across the front of it works too. The closer to the mic you are the deeper, richer and nicer your voice will sound.
